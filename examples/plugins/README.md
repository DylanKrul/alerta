Plugin Examples
===============

See the [alerta contrib repo](https://github.com/alerta/alerta-contrib/tree/master/plugins) for
a comprehensive list of plugins that can be used as-is or as examples for your own environment.

Included here, is a simple example of a routing rules plugin that takes advantage of the
`BLACKOUT_NOTIFICATION` setting that can be enable for the default `blackout` plugin.
